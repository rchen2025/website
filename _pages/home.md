### Hi!

I'm Richard, a current junior in high school. When I first started high school, I had no idea what I was going to do in the future. Now, I hope to use my diverse experiences in physics, math, and computer science to create accessible technologies that address problems in the world around us. To do so, I've dabbled in [materials science](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/garcia/summer_program/about) and [space physics](https://sites.google.com/site/toshinishimurabu/research?authuser=0) research, and I hope to combine these two interests in college. My past works include making cheaper and more environmentally-friendly hydrogen fuel cells as well as characterizing how STEVE (purple sky stuff) negatively impacts GPS communications. 

### About me

I was born and raised near Dallas, TX, where I spent the first 15 years of my life. I can confidently say 80% of my childhood was spent reading books at Barnes and Noble and the other 20% was spent designing models in Lego Digital Designer (rip). I now live in the Boston area, where I've learned to replace Tex-Mex and Texan barbecue with lobster rolls and clam chowder (ouch!). Outside of research, I'm also a hobbyist astronomer, trombonist, crocheter, and curator of East Asian media.
