### Hi!

I'm Richard, a current junior in high school. When I first started high school, I had no idea what I was going to do in the future. Now, I hope to use my diverse experiences in physics, math, and computer science to create accessible technologies that address problems in the world around us. To do so, I've dabbled in materials science and space physics research, and I hope to combine these two interests in college. My past works include making cheaper and more environmentally-friendly hydrogen fuel cells as well as characterizing how STEVE (purple sky stuff) negatively impacts GPS communications. 

### About me

I was born and raised near Dallas, TX, where I spent the first 15 years of my life. I can confidently say 80% of my childhood was spent reading books at Barnes and Noble and the other 20% was spent designing models in Lego Digital Designer (rip). Since then, I've moved to the Boston area, battled a tick bite, and hit Platinum 4 in League of Legends. Outside of research, I'm also a hobbyist astronomer, trombonist, crocheter, and curator of East Asian media.
